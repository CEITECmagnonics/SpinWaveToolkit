Examples
========

Here is a list of examples that demonstrate how to use the SpinWaveToolkit. The list is not exhaustive, but it provides a good starting point for understanding the capabilities of the module. If you have any questions on how to do more intricate calculations, try posting your question in the `Discussions on our GitHub page <https://github.com/CEITECmagnonics/SpinWaveToolkit/discussions>`_.
